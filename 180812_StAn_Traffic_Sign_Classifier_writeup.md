## 1. Data set preparation

### 1. Loading the existing data

I loaded the provided traffic signs data set and used basic Python operations to get an overview of the content:

```
Number of training examples = 34799
Number of validation examples = 4410
Number of testing examples = 12630
Image data shape = (32, 32, 3)
Number of classes = 43
```

The numerics of neural networks work best if the mean of the input data is zero. I used the following equations to normalize all input data to be between -1 and 1.

```python
# normalize input data
X_train_norm = np.asarray(((X_train / 127.5) - 1), np.float32)
X_valid_norm = np.asarray(((X_valid / 127.5) - 1), np.float32)
X_test_norm = np.asarray(((X_test / 127.5) - 1), np.float32)
```

As the color of traffic signs is used very intentionally to cluster signs by their importance, I decided that my detection algorithm should not be based on gray scale images only. Therefore, I left the color channel in the input data.

I did not augment the training data set by generating additional input using transformations. This is a potential future improvement.

### 2. Visualization of the data

In order to plot a set of traffic sign images with labels I created the function `plot_traffic_signs`. I used this function to understand the picture content by looking at the training dataset in the following ways.

* 30 random images

![alt text][image1]

* 30 random images of the same random label

![alt text][image2]

* A very high contrast image for each label (selected by looking for the highest contrast in the center of the image)

![alt text][image3]

* The average image for each label (calculated by averaging the individual color channels of all images with the same label)

![alt text][image4]

## 2. Convolutional neural network architecture

### 1. Model definition

I started by adapting the `LeNet` example to take color images as input.

My first intention was to create a very flexible set of functions that defines a typical type of convolutional neural network based on a few input parameters for the graph layout. Unfortunately, I ran into the issue that I couldn't get the same result when choosing the parameters to represent the simple `LeNet` example. My attempts are documented in the functions `LeNet_adjusted_method` and `LeNet_adjusted_inlinemethod`. I suspect that the way Python transfers variables between functions and how I implemented this leads to missing links in the Tensorflow graph during execution.

I reverted back to defining all Tensorflow variables in a single function `LeNet_adjusted3`. The high level structure of the convolutional neural network is shown below as generated by this function.

```
Convolutional layer   1 : [32, 32] input dimension with depth 3 and [28, 28] output dimensions with depth 18
Convolutional layer   2 : [28, 28] input dimension with depth 18 and [20, 20] output dimensions with depth 54
Pooling layer         2 : [20, 20] input dimension with depth 54 and [10, 10] output dimensions with depth 54
Convolutional layer   3 : [10, 10] input dimension with depth 54 and [6, 6] output dimensions with depth 128
Fully connected layer 1 : 4608 input dimensions and 800 output dimensions
Fully connected layer 2 : 800 input dimensions and 84 output dimensions
Fully connected layer 3 : 84 input dimensions and 43 output dimensions
```

I designed the first convolutional layer with a filter size of 5 to detect 18 features instead of 6 like `LeNet`, because I am using 3 color channels in the input data. I intentionally skipped pooling in the first layer to keep as much detail as possible.

The second convolutional layer uses a larger filter size of 9 to detect larger features in the picture. I decided to triple the number of possible features when combining smaller features. To keep the network reasonably small, the second layer uses max pooling with a stride of 2.

The third convolutional layer again uses a filter size of 5 and transforms most of the remaining image structure into a total of 128 features. No pooling is used in the third layer as the size of the network is reasonably small.

The following three fully connected layers transform the features into class probabilities by continuously reducing the dimensions from 4608 to 800 to 84 and finally 43 - one class for each traffic sign label.

Each layer of the convolutional neural network `LeNet_adjusted3` uses RELU units followed by dropout except the last fully connected layer.

The model pipeline uses the `AdamOptimizer` from Tensorflow for training. The loss function is based on `reduce_mean` from Tensorflow using `softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits`. To further avoid overfitting, the weight matrices of the first and second convolutional layer get regularized using `l2_loss`.

The model accuracy is evaluated by calculating the average difference between the predicted labels and the one hot encoded input labels.

### 2. Hyper parameter selection and training

All layers use random states as initial values with a mean of zero and standard deviation of 0.1. The following hyperparameters were used to train the model that has been used in the following sections. The variable `epochs` defines the number of training epochs. The `batch_size` defines how many inputs are used between every update of the internal parameters. The learning rate `rate` is slightly smaller than the standard `AdamsOptimizer` setting to allow a smoother progression. All layers with dropout keep 70 percent of their connections as defined by `keep_prob`. The parameter `beta` is used as factor during regularization of the convolutional weights in the loss function.

```
# define constants
epochs = 50
batch_size = 128
rate = 0.0005
keep_prob = 0.7
beta = 0.1
```

The training progress is shown in the following diagram. After 50 epochs the model achieved an accuracy of 96.0 percent.

### 3. Test of model performance after training

The accuracy on the test data set is 94.3 percent.

## 3. Predictions with the trained model

### 1. Test images from the web

To further test whether the model is good in not only predicting the images on which it has been trained, 6 images of Grman traffic signs have been found using Google's image search.

![alt text][image6]

The model accurately predicts each of these traffic signs as shown in the following pictures. The top 5 predictions are shown using the average image for each of these labels. The bar charts show the softmax probability for each prediction.

As a last step, I normalized the image data because ...

I decided to generate additional data because ... 

To add more data to the the data set, I used the following techniques because ... 

Here is an example of an original image and an augmented image:

![alt text][image3]

The difference between the original data set and the augmented data set is the following ... 


#### 2. Describe what your final model architecture looks like including model type, layers, layer sizes, connectivity, etc.) Consider including a diagram and/or table describing the final model.

My final model consisted of the following layers:

| Layer         		|     Description	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Input         		| 32x32x3 RGB image   							| 
| Convolution 3x3     	| 1x1 stride, same padding, outputs 32x32x64 	|
| RELU					|												|
| Max pooling	      	| 2x2 stride,  outputs 16x16x64 				|
| Convolution 3x3	    | etc.      									|
| Fully connected		| etc.        									|
| Softmax				| etc.        									|
|						|												|
|						|												|
 


#### 3. Describe how you trained your model. The discussion can include the type of optimizer, the batch size, number of epochs and any hyperparameters such as learning rate.

To train the model, I used an ....

#### 4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.

My final model results were:
* training set accuracy of ?
* validation set accuracy of ? 
* test set accuracy of ?

If an iterative approach was chosen:
* What was the first architecture that was tried and why was it chosen?
* What were some problems with the initial architecture?
* How was the architecture adjusted and why was it adjusted? Typical adjustments could include choosing a different model architecture, adding or taking away layers (pooling, dropout, convolution, etc), using an activation function or changing the activation function. One common justification for adjusting an architecture would be due to overfitting or underfitting. A high accuracy on the training set but low accuracy on the validation set indicates over fitting; a low accuracy on both sets indicates under fitting.
* Which parameters were tuned? How were they adjusted and why?
* What are some of the important design choices and why were they chosen? For example, why might a convolution layer work well with this problem? How might a dropout layer help with creating a successful model?

If a well known architecture was chosen:
* What architecture was chosen?
* Why did you believe it would be relevant to the traffic sign application?
* How does the final model's accuracy on the training, validation and test set provide evidence that the model is working well?
 

### Test a Model on New Images

#### 1. Choose five German traffic signs found on the web and provide them in the report. For each image, discuss what quality or qualities might be difficult to classify.

Here are five German traffic signs that I found on the web:

![alt text][image4] ![alt text][image5] ![alt text][image6] 
![alt text][image7] ![alt text][image8]

The first image might be difficult to classify because ...

#### 2. Discuss the model's predictions on these new traffic signs and compare the results to predicting on the test set. At a minimum, discuss what the predictions were, the accuracy on these new predictions, and compare the accuracy to the accuracy on the test set (OPTIONAL: Discuss the results in more detail as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric).

Here are the results of the prediction:

| Image			        |     Prediction	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Stop Sign      		| Stop sign   									| 
| U-turn     			| U-turn 										|
| Yield					| Yield											|
| 100 km/h	      		| Bumpy Road					 				|
| Slippery Road			| Slippery Road      							|


The model was able to correctly guess 4 of the 5 traffic signs, which gives an accuracy of 80%. This compares favorably to the accuracy on the test set of ...

#### 3. Describe how certain the model is when predicting on each of the five new images by looking at the softmax probabilities for each prediction. Provide the top 5 softmax probabilities for each image along with the sign type of each probability. (OPTIONAL: as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, visualizations can also be provided such as bar charts)

The code for making predictions on my final model is located in the 11th cell of the Ipython notebook.

For the first image, the model is relatively sure that this is a stop sign (probability of 0.6), and the image does contain a stop sign. The top five soft max probabilities were

| Probability         	|     Prediction	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| .60         			| Stop sign   									| 
| .20     				| U-turn 										|
| .05					| Yield											|
| .04	      			| Bumpy Road					 				|
| .01				    | Slippery Road      							|


For the second image ...
